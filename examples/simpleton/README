This was added to have more examples. This is not the main simpleton thread.

This repository contains many projects, each contained in their own directory.  The bash
commands below show how to run the simpleton project.

First, notice that the makefile of the simpleton project has been modified with:
  export CNY_PERSONALITY_PATH=../../personalities
   
To compile the project and simulator:
  cd cae_simpleton/src
  make
  
To run on the software simulator:
  ./run
  
To run on the hardware simulator:
  ./run -vsim
  
To run on the coprocessor:
  ./runcp
  
To rebuild the bitfile:

  cd cae_simpleton/phys
  make
  make release
  cd ../../
  rm ./personalities/65100.1.1.1.0/ae_fpga.tgz
  cp ./{release directory}/cae_fpga.tgz        ./personalities/65100.1.1.1.0/ae_fpga.tgz
  rm -rf ./{release directory}

To give cae_simpleton a new personality number or name, the following files would need to be edited:
/personalities/customdb       (edit name-number pairings)
/cae_simpleton/src/UserApp.c  (edit name)
/cae_simpleton/sim/CaeIsa.cpp (edit number)
