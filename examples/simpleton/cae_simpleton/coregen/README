To include IP from Xilinx ISE's Core Generator, follow these steps.

Step 1) Open ISE:

  ise &

Step 2) Start a new project (Virtex 5 XC5VLX330 FF1760 for HC-1)
Step 3) Open the Core Generator from ISE (Tools -> Core Generator)
Step 4) Start a new CoreGen project with the following settings:
       Part
          Family: Virtex5
          Device: xc5vlx330
          Package: ff1760
          Speed: -2
       Generation
          Simulation Model: Structural
Step 5) Generate your cores
Step 6) Locate the ipcore_dir in your ISE project directory
Step 7) Copy the following file types for each IP core into this folder (coregen)

 .v   - verilog files for simulation
 .ngc - netlist for the Xilinx build
 .xco - config file to regenerate the core

You can also add other directories using the following variable in the makefiles:

XILINX_CORE_DIRS += ./other_dir
