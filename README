Convey Development Support
The purpose of this project is to support Convey development on the convey-1 (a Convey HC-2) at Iowa State University. It's original intention is to help students taking CprE 584. It is designed to complement the support given at conveysupport.com and other development tools Convey provides. 
The file structure should be kept simple: scripts, lib, bin, inc, doc, res, dev, examples
scripts: scripts to help with convey development. If support files are needed for the script place them in res (resources).
lib: Library files (.a extension). 
bin: Binaries. Executable scripts should be in scripts. Compiled executables should be in bin.
inc: .h files. Should have an associated file in lib.
doc: Documentation. Have a pdf of the file and the source code in a 
folder. For example tutorial1.pdf and tutorial1/. Don't include documentation without an editable source eg. Convey Manuals.
res: Resources. Support files for binaries and scripts. Should be kept small in size. tar and gz files (files should have the .tgz extension).
dev: Development. Each developer/project should have a folder. Work you want others to use should be in the same structure as this project eg. the folders scripts, lib, bin, inc, doc, res, (dev), examples.
examples: Example projects. caeFirst and cae_vadd are good examples. Note. I think we should get permission before loading cae_vadd.
The Convey Development Support project at ISU is a support kit to help you into the strange and confusing world of High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing (HPRC) on Convey.
